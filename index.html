      <h1>Hi, Let's <span>"Turn concepts into digital realities"</span></h1>
      <p>I am Kinley Wangyel Gyeltshen, a dedicated ICT student from Drukgyel, Paro, Bhutan, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Education in ICT. Growing up in an urban environment allowed me to witness the intersection of tradition and modernity firsthand, fostering a sense of curiosity, ambition, and independence. From an early age, I found myself drawn to the world of technology and digital learning, and over time, this curiosity blossomed into a deep passion for programming, databases, and innovative problem-solving.

I thrive on exploring how technology can be applied to real-world challenges. Whether it is designing a dynamic program, analyzing data, or learning a new tool online, I enjoy pushing boundaries and discovering creative solutions. Beyond academics, I immerse myself in a variety of activities that nourish both mind and body. I love reading, listening to music, watching films, engaging in prayers, and learning new skills online. I also value spending time outdoors, whether taking walks in nature or participating in sports and recreational activities with friends.

My aspiration is to become an ICT educator who inspires and empowers students to utilize technology effectively and responsibly in their everyday lives. I aim to spark curiosity, nurture critical thinking, and guide students in integrating modern technological tools with Bhutanese cultural values, producing solutions that are both impactful and meaningful. I firmly believe that when students learn to blend innovation with ethical understanding, they can create positive change and contribute to society in significant ways.</p>

        <h3>Drukgyel Lower School</h3>
        <p>I spent my lower school days in Drukgyel Lower School, which is located in Drukgyel, Paro. I studied there till my 8th grade, and it was a place where I built many of my foundational skills and values. The teachers were very supportive, and the school provided me with opportunities to participate in both academic and extracurricular activities, which helped shape my confidence and discipline. It was during this time that I was first introduced to Information Technology for educational purposes. Learning how to use a computer, basic applications, and the internet opened my eyes to the possibilities of technology in learning and problem-solving. This early exposure gradually sparked my curiosity and inspired me to take ICT more seriously as I moved forward in my education.</p>

        <h3>Drukgyel High School</h3>
        <p>My high school was located just beside my lower school, so the transition from one to the other felt very natural. All I really had to do was keep working hard and passing my grades in order to move forward. When I look back on my high school days, I remember them as some of the most enjoyable years of my life. Like every other student, I had my fair share of fun, laughter, and challenges, but those years also gave me some of the most memorable experiences and friendships. Academically, high school was where my interest in ICT began to grow deeper. I had the opportunity to explore Turtle, Python, and CodeMonkey, which made learning programming both exciting and fun. These experiences not only developed my problem-solving and logical thinking but also motivated me to consider ICT as a serious field of study for my future.</p>

        <h3>Samtse College of Education</h3>
        <p>At present, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Education in Information and Communication Technology at Samtse College of Education, which is part of the Royal University of Bhutan. This program is carefully designed to train future educators to teach coding, digital literacy, and ICT skills effectively to students.

During my time at Samtse College of Education, I am building expertise in programming, database management, and ICT applications. The curriculum combines educational theory with hands-on experience, highlighting the use of modern technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics.

This academic journey goes beyond gaining technical knowledge; it aims to prepare me to inspire and equip students with the skills needed to thrive in an increasingly technology-driven world.</p>

        <h3>Sound Sensor Car</h3>
        <p>Developed an Arduino-based car model integrated with sound sensors and a buzzer to detect unusual or loud noises in the surrounding environment. This project demonstrates the working principles of anti-theft alert systems in vehicles, highlighting the practical applications of sound detection, sensor technology, and embedded electronics. By building and programming the system, we were able to explore how real-time data from sensors can trigger automatic responses, providing a hands-on understanding of the interaction between hardware, software, and practical security solutions in modern automotive technology.</p>

        <h3>College Club Website</h3>
        <p>This project is primarily developed for our PRG-303 module, where our team of five programmers collaborated to design and implement the system. The main objective of the project is to create a unified online platform that allows students to access all essential information and services in one convenient location. Through this platform, students can stay updated with the latest announcements, join clubs, participate in various events, and utilize club-related services seamlessly. By integrating multiple functionalities into a single system, the project aims to simplify communication, enhance student engagement, and provide a centralized digital solution that makes campus life more organized and accessible.</p>

        <h3>Crypto Token</h3>
        <p>This is a crypto token that I developed in collaboration with two of my friends as part of our effort to explore blockchain technology and its practical applications. The token is designed to function as a digital currency, enabling us to trade and make online transactions without the need to rely on traditional financial systems or government-backed currencies. One of the most exciting aspects of this project is the incentive mechanism we built into the system: whenever others use our token for transactions, I earn a small transaction fee. This not only creates a passive income stream but also provides a practical demonstration of how decentralized finance (DeFi) works in real life. Through this project, I have gained valuable knowledge about blockchain networks, smart contracts, and digital asset management, while at the same time creating something of real value that can grow with adoption. It has been a rewarding experience that combines technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship.</p>
